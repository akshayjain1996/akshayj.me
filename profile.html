                <p>I am in my Third year studying Computer Science at University of Toronto.</p>
                <p>Current GPA : 3.54</p>
                <p>Expected Graduation : 2017</p>

                    <h5>About Me</h5>
                </div>
                <p>I have some experience working in the industry. I did an internship last summer at TXIO, which is a globally recognized company as a leader in enterprise software solutions for financial markets. Here I developed a new User Interface in JAVAFX, which displayed everything the system offered (the existing UIs were customized as per clients need). One major challenge I faced working here was to get the code in an older version of Java to work with latest technologies. I used technologies like  Byte Code Manipulation, Reflection, etc. to get around such problems. Another challenge was that noone in the office had any experience with many of the technologies and frameworks I used, so I was mostly on my own dealing with the challenges. <br><br>

Currently, I am working at the DGP Lab at UofT, which is a HCI and Computer Graphics lab. Here, I got a chance to work with some cutting edge equipments like 3-D motion capturing systems, Lazer Scanners, etc. My role here was to help Setup, Calibrate, Test the equipments. I also helped maintain the website, wikis, etc. I also interacted with grad and phd students and faculty members.<br> <br>

I am also involved in a capstone project course. I am working with 3 industrial engineers and one other computer scientist to set some standards for canine restraints in cars. My main task here is to develop a system to collect canine data which can be used to test the existing products for their effectiveness (there are no standards / data collections for this in the world).
<br><br>
One of my biggest strengths is that I am a great team player. I am a part of the organizing committee for UofTHacks 2016. I was also a DCS Ambassador last year, where I helped in organizing various DCS events. I can collaborate well with others; I have experience in commonly used Version Control Systems, Design patterns, and the various strategies that development teams use (like Agile development, the popular communication tools, etc). 
<br><br>
I am a good coder as well.  I have experience with Full Stack Development. I have mostly worked with Python, using frameworks like Flask, Jinja2, SQLAlchemy, etc. I have some basic knowledge about PHP and Ruby on Rails. I have also worked with SQL and various DBMS, XML and JSON. I am good with HTML and CSS, and JavaScript and some popular frameworks like Angular, Node, etc. I also have Android development experience; I have developed apps that use data from various sensors, have system permissions, etc.
<br><br>
I have used some Big Data Analysis tools like Hadoop, Map Reduce, Storm, etc (used Virtual Boxes and fake data for some basic computations). I am presently taking courses on Operating Systems, Network programming and Machine Learning, and I should be good with these topics before the start of my work term. 
<br><br>
I also have knowledge about game development. I have developed games in Java, Javascript, Python, Android, etc. I am also very good at Math. I have knowledge about concepts like Multi variable calculus, stats, linear algebra, etc.
